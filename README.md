## 🚀 Description

This repository consists of my work for the Frontend Data course, which is part of the [Information Design - Tech Track](https://github.com/cmda-tt) given in the 3rd year of the study Communication and Multimedia design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam.

The goal of this course is to learn how to create a data visualisations using the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library, in which data can be explored through interaction of the user. The project I've worked on these 2 weeks fetches data about episodes of the populair tvshow 'Breaking Bad', and shows the ratings of all the episodes in a bar chart.

The criteria for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Kip-Hub/frontend-data/wiki/rubric)

## 📚 Wiki

Everything I have done during this project can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Kip-Hub/frontend-data/wiki).  
I will document my daily pursuits and progress in the [logboek](https://github.com/Kip-Hub/frontend-data/wiki/logboek) which can also be found on the wiki, along with some theoretical documentation and other project oriented documentation.

## 🧩 Data/resources

Although my first intent was to use the [Episodate API](https://www.episodate.com/api), which I already used during the previous [course](https://github.com/Kip-Hub/functional-programming). However I soon realised it doesn't contain alot of data that could be useful for creating visualisations.

So I started looking for another API to use instead. Resulting in the the data used in this project, now being obtained from the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api), which is an API that revolves around data from tv shows.
